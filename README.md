## Tidal from Scratch

I've created this repo to understand the core of tidal at a deeper level by re-implementing its core logic.
This part of the README will document my progress and could be helpful for people trying to understand tidal.
Disclaimer: This is not tidal, so take it with a grain of salt.

### Patterns as Functions of Time

The core primitive of tidal are Patterns, which are essentially functions of time:

```ts
let silence = (a, b) => [];
silence(0, 1); // []
silence(42, 79); // []
```

The above example is the most simple pattern I can think of: silence. It will always return an empty Array. The inputs `a` and `b` are the timespan we want to know about.

### We love repetition

The above example doesn't really do much, so let's implement another pattern that repeats the same thing over and over:

```js
let repeat = (a, b) => {
  let bag = [];
  while (a < b) {
    bag.push({ a, b: a + 1, value: "X" });
    a++;
  }
  return bag;
};
repeat(0, 1); // [{a: 0, b: 1, value: 'X'}]
repeat(0, 2); // [{a: 0, b: 1, value: 'X'}, {a: 1, b: 2, value: 'X'}]
repeat(1, 3); // [{a: 1, b: 2, value: 'X'}, {a: 2, b: 3, value: 'X'}]
```

This function will give us one object per whole number within the given time span.
The object contains the timespan during it is active + some value.

### Higher Order Functions

Ideally, we'd want to choose the value to repeat, so let's make it a higher order function:

```js
let repeat = (value) => (a, b) => {
  let bag = [];
  while (a < b) {
    bag.push({ a, b: a + 1, value });
    a++;
  }
  return bag;
};
let snakes = repeat("snake");
let dogs = repeat("dog");
snakes(0, 2); // [{a: 0, b: 1, value: 'snake'},{a: 1, b: 2, value: 'snake'}]
dogs(1, 3); // [{a: 1, b: 2, value: 'dog'}, {a: 2, b: 3, value: 'dog'}]
```

Higher order just means we have a function that returns a function. The outer function takes a value and returns the inner function, which is a Pattern.

### It's Hap-pening

Our returned object could be expressed as a typescript type like this:

```ts
declare type Hap<T> = { a: number; b: number; value: T };
```

With these `Hap`'s, we can now define a Pattern like this:

```ts
declare type Pattern<T> = (a: number, b: number) => Hap<T>[];
```

Note that these typings are only a simplified version of what strudel or tidal use, but it's enough to get started thinking about Patterns.

### To be continued
